#What is Github?
GitHub is the world’s largest software development platform. It provides cloud storage for source code, supports all popular programming languages, and streamlines the iteration process.
GitHub is an open-source platform, and the community is really what fuels it. Millions of programmers and hobbyists download, review, and evaluate each other’s work.
Pushing the project to a shared, public repository makes it instantly discoverable for those 28M users.
Exposure and insight that you can get on GitHub are simply unmatched by any other platform. And this goes the other way around — you can discover code written by others, learn from it, and even use it for your projects.
